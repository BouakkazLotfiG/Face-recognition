# Face Recognition App

This project is a face recognition app that utilizes the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) methods for feature extraction and recognition.

## Features

- LBP (Local Binary Pattern) for texture-based feature extraction
- HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) for shape-based feature extraction
- Face recognition using extracted features
